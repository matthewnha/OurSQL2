Mike, here's that project I worked on for my database systems class, where we implemented the professor's design for a real-time OLAP/OLTP database that uses a lineage-based storage system. Not sure how deep you'd want to delve into this one, but it's just an example of me getting into the nitty gritty with Python. It's not the most pleasingly designed, but it was pretty technical project that had us pulling our hair out at times. We were tasked with writing the database memory to disk, but we decided to take the extra step and serialize the data to binary (lstore/diskmanager.py).
